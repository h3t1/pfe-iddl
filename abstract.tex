\noindent \section*{Abstract}
This report summarizes the work carried out over a period of six months at Cegedim SRH, in the context of the approval of the end-of-study project for the Master's degree in Data Engineering and Software Development at the Faculty of Science in Rabat.\\
	
The first stage of the work consisted in auditing and analyzing the architecture of an electronic document management portal called \textbf{Arkevia}, then to identify and correct the problems and anomalies detected, as well as to propose lines of improvement according to the architectural audit. Then, in a second phase, the work focused on the notification mechanism responsible for informing users of documents recently deposited in their Arkevia safes. Given the importance Cegedim places on the quality of its solutions, it was agreed to overhaul this mechanism and make it independent of the Arkevia main application. The resulting application is primarily based on a multi-threaded batch approach using Spring Boot and Spring Batch technologies.
